        <p class="about-text">My name is Hai Anh Nguyen, but I go by Anh (pronounced as "Ann"). 
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
            My coding journey started when I had to develop a Wordpress blog for a university project, taking me right back to the days I messed around with profiles on blog sites such as MySpace and Tumblr. One thing led to another, and soon I was diving into Python and JavaScript on Codecademy and freeCodeCamp. 
            I even got a kick out of tackling challenges on Codewars!
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">Originally, I was all set for a career in education as I was working as a Learning Support Assistant at a primary school, covering art and creative writing lessons to Year 6 pupils. But, I soon figured out coding excited me more than the prospect of teaching as it presented more academic challenges while tapping into my lifelong love of solving maths problems and puzzles.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">In order to transition my passion to a serious job, I took on a coding bootcamp at La Fosse Academy, acing their technical tests and interviews. This bootcamp covered all the bases of full-stack web development (including databases and APIs) and was where I advanced my JavaScript skills. And just recently, I completed a Networking and Cloud Services Technician (IT) course by Netcom Training, where I gained a theoretical understanding of software development (SDLCs & project management) while furthering my knowledge in networking, security, Cloud, hardware and software, data & privacy laws, and IT policies.
        I also participated in Code First Girls MOOCs and group challenges since last summer (2023).
        <p class="about-text">
            When I'm not coding, I'm usually hanging out with my cat, cooking up recipes I find on YouTube, cycling around London, or gaming on my PC (mostly Stardew Valley since their big update).
